## üìÅ Repository Structure

**assignments/**

- **drone_aape/**  
  This project focuses on an autonomous drone agent tasked with Adaptive Aerial Path Execution (AAPE). The drone is programmed to navigate dynamic environments by processing sensor data in real-time, avoiding obstacles, and optimizing flight paths. The implementation covers advanced control algorithms, sensor fusion, and adaptive planning techniques to ensure efficient and safe navigation.

- **flower_collector/**  
  The Flower Collector project involves an autonomous agent that explores an environment to detect, approach, and collect flowers. The system integrates computer vision for flower recognition, pathfinding algorithms for navigation, and resource management strategies to maximize collection efficiency. This project emphasizes robust perception and interaction within an uncertain environment.

- **tic-tac-toe/**  
  This project implements an autonomous agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe using strategic decision-making. Employing classic game theory methods like the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, the agent guarantees optimal play. The focus is on demonstrating strategic reasoning, state evaluation, and handling of adversarial conditions within a simple yet foundational game setting.
