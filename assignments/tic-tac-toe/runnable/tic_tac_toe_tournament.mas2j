	/* The TournamentEnvironment class takes two parameters:
	 *  - the first number represents the number of agents. This number should correspond to the number
	 *	   of agents indicated below.
	 *  - The second number represents how often each pair of agents will play against each other.
	 *	  This number is optional. If not specified then its value is set to 1.
	 *	  
	 *	  Example:
	 *	- If there are 2 agents (agentA and agentB), and the number of repetitions is 5, 
	 *	 then they will play 10 games: 5 games in which agentA makes the first move and 5 games in which agentB makes the first move.
	 *	 
	 *	- In general, with m agents and n repetitions the total number of games is n * m * (m-1).
